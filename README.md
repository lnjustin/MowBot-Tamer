# MowBot-Tamer

MowBot Tamer tames your otherwise unruly robot mower:

# Dynamic Mower Parking and Pausing
- Keep your childish mower from playing in the rain or irrigation sprinklers, mucking up your grass.
- Make sure your bright-eyed mower hits the snooze in the morning and doesn't mow before the morning dew burns off (mowing dry grass gives a cleaner cut)
- Command your workaholic mower to rest during scorching heat that stresses your grass.
- Tired of seeing your pesky mower? Require it to mow only when you're away, only between sunset and sunrise, or only when a switch is on/off
- Command your fiesty mower to "stay" (pause) when there's motion, a door opens/closes, and more

# Dynamic Mowing Window
- Teach your naive mower manners by mowing at times that depend on sunrise and sunset, e.g., only mow 30 minutes after sunrise or stop mowing at sunset
- Train your heavy-footed mower to not trample your grass by mowing more than necessary, but retain mowing window flexibility. Specify a large mowing window but end the mowing window prematurely once the mower has mowed for a certain amount of time.
- Instruct your defeated mower on persistence. If your mower can't mow enough during your preferred mowing window, get it back out there during a backup mowing window, e.g., preferably mow in the morning between sunrise and noon, but mow in the evening between 6pm and sunset if it's raining in the morning (otherwise don't mow in the evening).

# Dynamic Cutting Height
- Coach your unsophisticated mower on proper cutting height etiquette. If the mower hasn't been able to mow much lately, dynamically increase the cutting height, in order to avoid taking off too much. As the mower gets to mow more, dynamically ratchet the cutting height back down to your desired level.

# Dynamic Mowbot Tamer Configurations
- Set up different Mowbot Tamer configurations for different times of the year, as governed by date or by average high/low temperature
- Dynamically turn Mowbot Tamer on/off with a switch

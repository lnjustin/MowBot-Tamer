# MowBot-Tamer

MowBot Tamer tames your otherwise unruly robot mower:

# Dynamic Mower Parking and Pausing
- Keep your childish mower from playing in the rain or irrigation sprinklers, mucking up your grass.
- Make sure your bright-eyed mower hits the snooze in the morning and doesn't mow before the morning dew burns off (mowing dry grass gives a cleaner cut)
- Command your workaholic mower to rest during scorching heat that stresses your grass.
- Tired of seeing your pesky mower? Require it to mow only when you're away, only between sunset and sunrise, or only when a switch is on/off
- Command your fiesty mower to "stay" (pause) when there's motion, a door opens/closes, and more

# Dynamic Mowing Window
- Teach your naive mower manners by mowing at times that depend on sunrise and sunset, e.g., only mow 30 minutes after sunrise or stop mowing at sunset
- Train your heavy-footed mower to not trample your grass by mowing more than necessary, but retain mowing window flexibility. Specify a large mowing window but park the mower once the mower has mowed for a certain amount of time.
